# Quotes from great personalities #

A Simple React web app which shows Quotes from great personalities.
  * Minimalist UI
  * Easy to understand code
  * Lots of Quotes
  * Pagination Feature

Here I have used [this](https://type.fit/api/quotes) API to get quotes text and used [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paginate) package to make pagination.
